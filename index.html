  <h2>A DNS Service Discovery focused DNS server</h1>
</div>
<div>
  <p>dnsxd supports the protocols needed to do wide-area service discovery with Apple Bonjour:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DNS Update - to allow clients to create DNS records for services</li>
    <li>DNS Update Leases - to allow records to expire if a client loses network connectivity</li>
    <li>DNS Long Lived Queries (LLQ) - to allow clients to receive real-time query updates</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All DNS Update messages must be authenticated with Transaction Signatures (TSIGs) and clients can optionally be restricted to only manipulating DNS records used to do DNS Service Discovery.
  <p>Limited DNSSEC support is available in the form of RSA SHA1 signatures and NSEC3 white-lies for authenticated non-existence.</p>
  <p>Zone and related data is stored in CouchDB and can be replicated to other servers via CouchDB's built-in replication functionality. Other storage backends can be selected via a configuration option.</p>
